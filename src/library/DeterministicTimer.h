/* A timer that gives deterministic values, at least in the main thread.
 *
 * Deterministic means that calling frameBoundary() and querying this timer
 * in the same order will produce the same stream of results,
 * independently of anything else like the system clock or CPU speed.
 *
 * The main thread is defined as the thread that called SDL_Init(),
 *
 * The trick to making this timer deterministic and still run at a normal speed is:
 * we define a frame rate beforehand and always tell the game it is running that fast
 * from frame to frame. Then we do the waiting ourselves for each frame (using system timer).
 * this also lets us support "fast forward" without changing the values the game sees.
